Face Value is a Bayesian probabilistic framework that synthesizes machine learning-driven facial feature extraction, hierarchical probabilistic modeling, and cultural consensus analysis to deconstruct the latent structures governing human perceptual and decision-making biases. By leveraging ElasticNet regression with L1 and L2 regularization, the model optimizes feature selection and multicollinearity reduction, incorporating Individual Typology Angle (ITA) skin tone analysis, Haar Cascade, and LBPH based skin segmentation to explore the intersection of facial morphology, pigmentation, and cognitive bias formation. To capture cerebral uncertainty and infer latent consensus structures in subjective ratings, I implemented hierarchical Bayesian inference via NumPyro, employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) with the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS) to approximate posterior distributions over perceptual biases. This approach enables the quantification of uncertainty in perceptual biases, revealing structured dependencies between facial metrics, sociocultural priors, and evaluative heuristics.

Key Features:

    Facial measurement analysis to detect implicit biases in automated or human decision-making.
    Application of DIF methodologies to evaluate disparities in loan approvals across demographic groups.
    Insights into the role of skin color and facial characteristics in financial decision-making.

The goal of this project is to promote fairness and equity in loan approval systems by providing actionable recommendations for bias mitigation based on robust data-driven insights, leveraging the Diversity in Faces dataset and methodologies.
