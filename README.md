This project investigates bias in loan approval processes by analyzing facial measurements and key demographic factors, such as skin color. The study leverages methodologies derived from the Diversity in Faces (DIF) report to identify and quantify potential disparities in decision-making. By utilizing advanced facial measurement techniques and integrating demographic data, the project aims to uncover systemic biases and propose equitable solutions for financial institutions.

Key Features:

    Facial measurement analysis to detect implicit biases in automated or human decision-making.
    Application of DIF methodologies to evaluate disparities in loan approvals across demographic groups.
    Insights into the role of skin color and facial characteristics in financial decision-making.

The goal of this project is to promote fairness and equity in loan approval systems by providing actionable recommendations for bias mitigation based on robust data-driven insights, leveraging the Diversity in Faces dataset and methodologies.
